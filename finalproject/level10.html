          <p class="mb-4">Level 10 is a fictional DJ (disc jockey). For a college project, I creating Branding and Identity, Merchandise and Marketing designs for the music artist. Pre-production was required to include a mood board and color scheme, with production needing to include logos, stickers, t-shirts, flyer and poster designs. The objective was to design and develop a brand for a new artist, promote the artist and advertise for an upcoming performance.</p>

			<p class="col-12 col-md-8 p-0 mb-4 description-center">Level 10 produces electronic dance music, which is known to be quite loud. That said, I wanted to ensure branding elements were designed to incorporate the ideas of pulsating music and rising/increasing volume. It was important to highlight the notion of a traditional number scale as seen on an elevator, with 10 being the peak.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="col-12 col-md-9 mb-4 p-0 description-center">Often times music artists have multiple logos, so I decided to produce two for Level 10. The first being elevator buttons highlighting the 10th level, with an upward-pointing arrow stating that the level has been reached from below. The second is a tiled sound wave chart that an amplifier would display when measuring different sound frequencies. Colors start out dark at the bottom and become brighter as pitches increase. The "10" is purposely made a warm pink to stand out from the rest of the logo's body.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="col-12 col-md-9 mb-4 p-0 description-center">Stickers are typically small, and therefore, should be expressive yet not overly detailed. The first sticker is reminiscent of a commercial building's floor-numbering with a creative twist. Having the "1" double as both a "1" and "L" is both economical, and unique. To add additional diversity, the "V" takes on a light-blue overlay, giving it a lightened effect. The second sticker is meant to represent a sound dial turned-up to the maximum level of 10. To add another hidden meaning, it also looks like a stimulated eye, potentially struck with the mezmerizing visuals of a Level 10 performance.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="col-12 col-md-9 mb-4 p-0 description-center">To offer individuals a way to show their support in style, I explored different designs. Beginning with the male design, a swiftly-increasing bar chart with 10 levels and a gradated color application appears at the base of the t-shirt, a placement not often seen. The female design is a take on an elevator bringing passengers up to the 10th floor of a building. Both of these designs purposely did not include the complete name of the artist, but instead, rely on the communication of meaningful symbolism that is synonymous with the artist's name. The youth design was inspired by Iron Man's Arc Reactor, which is the chest piece that powers his famous suits. Similar to that chest piece, the placement of the glowing circle is a metaphor that Level 10's music is the heartbeat of whoever wears the shirt.</p>

			<p class="col-12 col-md-8 p-0 mb-4 description-center">This promotional flyer was not intended to be for any particular event, but instead, acts as an advertisement for the artist. That said, I wanted to really emphasize one of the logos, and pair it with a catchy slogan consistent with the brand's theme of arriving at a higher level. There is also a mysterious element I wanted to leave people with, where nothing else is included in the design. The goal is for the intrigue of the unknown to give people an appetite to discover more about the artist.</p>

			<p class="col-12 col-md-8 p-0 mb-4 description-center">A blend of multiple elements displayed prior, this poster combines the elevator button-style logo and the elevator t-shirt design to create an all-encompassing concert advertisement. Here, the logo and t-shirt design work extremely well together, staying true to an elevator theme. The roof color extending up through the top of the poster creates repetition with the upward-pointing arrow of the logo. By extending the 10th-floor to the right, I manufacture a beam of contrast to highlight the date of the event. Text content is formatted and separated in a way that places an emphasis on the two most important elements: date and location.</p>
